# FLORA

FLORA: Future prediction of obstacle locations in traffic scenes for collision avoidances.

## Improve code
- [ ] Seperate dataset from models
- [ ] Delete simple lstm
- [ ] Seperate code in scripts, sgan into more folders (better naming)
- [ ] Refactor train.py (too long)
- [ ] Commit attention model in pooling and physical pooling, maybe remove if statements

## Cluster computing
- [ ] Make kubernetis work

## Improve model performance
- [ ] Check collision checking of oracle
